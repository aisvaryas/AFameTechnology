Welcome to the AFameTechnology repository! This repository contains two data science projects that demonstrate the application of machine learning and data analysis techniques using Python.

## Projects

### 1. Titanic Survival Analysis
This project analyzes the famous Titanic dataset to predict the survival chances of passengers. The dataset includes information about the passengers, such as their age, sex, class, and more.

#### Key Features:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing data to understand relationships between features and survival rates.
- **Modeling**: Building and evaluating machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and the confusion matrix.

#### Files:
- `titanicsurvival.py`: The Python script containing the entire analysis and model-building process.
- `Titanic-Dataset.csv`: The dataset used for the analysis.

### 2. Sales Data Analysis
This project involves analyzing a sales dataset to uncover trends, patterns, and insights that can help optimize business decisions.

#### Key Features:
- **Data Cleaning**: Converting data types, handling missing values, and data formatting.
- **Time-Series Analysis**: Analyzing sales and profit trends over time.
- **Category and Subcategory Performance**: Identifying top-performing categories and subcategories in terms of sales and profit.
- **Returns Analysis**: Examining the impact of returns on overall sales and profit.
- **Regional Analysis**: Analyzing sales and profit by region to identify high-performing areas.

#### Files:
- `SALES ANALYSIS.py`: The Python script containing the analysis and insights.
- `ECOMM DATA.xlsx`: The dataset used for analysis.

## Requirements
To run the scripts, you'll need the following Python libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn (for Titanic Survival Analysis)
- openpyxl (for reading Excel files)


## Datasets
The required datasets for each project are included in this repository:
-  `Titanic-Dataset.csv` for Titanic Survival Analysis.
- `ECOMM DATA.xlsx` for Sales Data Analysis.
